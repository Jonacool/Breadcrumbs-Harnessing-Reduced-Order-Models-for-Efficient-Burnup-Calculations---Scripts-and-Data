Dear researcher,

These scripts and data were made during my thesis on Harnessing Reduced Order Models for Efficient Burnup Calculations.

The scripts in this repo require the python package found in:
https://github.com/Jonacool/BurnupROM-PythonPackage

The folders contain various scripts, data and notebooks I have used throughout my masters research. With this, it should be possible to directly replicate any of the results reported in my thesis. Most of the code is commented quite well, so it should be possible to grasp. If not, please sent me a message!

Good luck,
Jonathan
